## AVR input/output expansion

This is library that implements different input/output interfaces and other
utilities. Its target is to create simple and highly configurable pack of code for
simplifying development for AVR micro-controllers.  
Code is targeted for five different chips, ATmega328p, ATmega32u4, ATmega8A,
ATtiny4313 and ATtiny85. But support for more chips can be added.

### Getting started
To use this library, you have to create new project (you can copy template
directory). Then copy/clone this repository to your project. For more information
see file `doc/usage.md`.
